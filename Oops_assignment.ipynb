        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming method that organizes code by grouping related data and behavior into objects. It is based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes blueprints that define the structure and behavior of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " = A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and methods that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " = An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object from a class, it gets its own copy of the attributes and can use the methods defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        " = abstraction-hiding the complex implementation and showing only the essential features,use for reduce the complexity and make the code easy to run.\n",
        "  encapsulation-hiding the internal data and protecting it from direct access,use to protect the data andmaintain integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Dunder method are special methods in Python that begin and end with two underscores: like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc. these allow us to define how your objects behave with built-in functions and operators (like +, len(), print(), etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "  = Inheritance is an OOP concept where a class (child) can inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent).\n",
        "   Inheritance helps us in Reusability of code,Reducing redundancy,Maintaining a clear hierarchy\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same superclass, while behaving differently based on their actual class.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to\n",
        " some of an object's attributes or methods.\n",
        " This is done by using access modifiers: public(.), protected(._), and private(.__).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object.It is automatically called when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = class methods and static methods are special types of methods that      belong to a class but behave differently from regular instance methods.\n",
        " > calss methods-it belongs to the class,not to the instance.use the  @calssmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        " > static method-use the @static method decorator. do not take the self or cls as the first parameter\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Method Overriding is an object-oriented programming feature that allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = The @property decorator in Python is used to convert a method into a read-only property 'allowing you to access it like an attribute', without calling it like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming because it enables flexibility, reusability, and scalability in code. It allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface, while allowing them to behave differently based on their class-specific implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is designed to be a base class that defines a common interface for its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " =Object-Oriented Programming offers a structured and modular approach to programming that makes code easier to write, understand, modify, and reuse.some benefits: Modularity,Reusability,Encapsulation,Polymorphism etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        " >calss variable - a class variable is a variable defined within a class but outside of any instance methods (like __init__). It is shared by all instances of that class. This means that if the value of a class variable is modified, the change will be reflected across all objects created from that class.\n",
        "\n",
        " >instance variable - An instance variable in Python is a variable that belongs to a specific instance (object) of a class. Each object created from a class will have its own independent copy of these variables, and the value of an instance variable can be different for each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Multiple Inheritance is a feature in Python where a child class can inherit from more than one parent class.This allows the child class to have the properties and methods of all parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " = Both __str__ and __repr__ are dunder methods used to define string representations of objects.\n",
        " >_str_ - Called by str(obj) and the print(obj) function.Meant to return a nicely formatted, readable description of the object,Used when displaying the object to end users.\n",
        "\n",
        " >_repr_ - Called by repr(obj) and in the Python shell.Should return a developer-friendly, unambiguous string,Used for debugging and logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = The super() function is used to call methods from a parent (super) class in a child class.It allows you to extend or override parent class behavior without directly naming the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = The __del__() method in Python is a destructor. It is a special method called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that do not behave like regular instance methods.\n",
        " >@staticmethod - Does not take self or cls as the first argument.It doesn't access class or instance variables.It behaves like a regular function but lives inside the class’s namespace for logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        " >@classmethod - Takes cls as the first argument (not self).It can access or modify class variables,Used to define factory methods or operate on the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same base class, especially when they share methods with the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " = Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple method calls are chained together in a single line using the dot (.) operator.Each method returns the object itself (usually self), allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " = The __call__() method makes an instance of a class callable like a regular function.BY defining the __call__() method inside a class, we can use an object of that class like a function.\n"
