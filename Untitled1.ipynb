        " - If a CI for a mean difference includes 0, it suggests no significant difference.\n",

        " - If a CI for a proportion includes the null value, the result is not statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Connection to Probability\n",
        " - A 95% CI does not mean the parameter has a 95% chance of being inside the interval.\n",
        " - Instead, it means that if we took 100 random samples and built 100 confidence intervals, about 95 of them would contain the true parameter.\n",
